# Welcome!
My name is Yana, here you can find information about my Android app 'Orthoepy'. Here [link] you can see a short video of how it works!
# How can you use this app?
Orthoepy combines a dictionary and a mini-game with a choice of the right answer from the two proposed and an opportunity to learn more about this word. Create an account to save your progress, or use it without authentication to quickly jump to word search in the dictionary!
# For what purposes is it developed?
Due to the peculiarities of the Russian language, memorizing the correct pronunciation of some words can be quite difficult even for native speakers. That's why I decided to create this app - to help users quickly memorize the correct pronunciation of tricky words during a game. 
# When appearance matters
I never liked sitting and cramming, so one of my main goals was to create a stylish and intuitive user interface. Simply put, I wanted to bring some color into the educational process and make it a little more fun, so although I tried to stick to monochrome shades for the convenience of words, I made the main color accents bright.
# When you need help
I also wanted to allow the user, when faced with unfamiliar words, to receive additional information about the meaning and rules of using this word from external libraries, encyclopedias and dictionaries directly from my application. By clicking on the word, you will instantly go to the link, and you will see the page of this word in the language dictionary.
# Additional resources and tools
When I created the application, I used the Firebase database to store words and user data, Wikipedia, the Android Material Design Library, and the GIMP graphics editor to design some of the user interface elements.
